description: >
  At Deloitte I worked in the Big Data & Analytics department. Working on-site with the client, I helped to built a platform that featured several use cases and their associated data processing and data landing pipelines. The focus of my work was technical, focussing on scalable configuration management and clean operations of the Hadoop platform. During my time at Deloitte I shifted my role from a junior to a more senior position. With that shift I switched focus to training the client and overseeing the smooth operation of the platform built.
