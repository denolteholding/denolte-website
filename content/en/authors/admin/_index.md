I am a student at Paderborn university. Prior, I worked as Consultant supporting the development, operation and scaling of Hadoop-based Big Data infrastructure
at client site. Nowadays, I am eager to explore new technologies when they come up and am always looking for my next project. Do you have a sidegig that needs to be completed
professionally and in a timely manner? Feel free to reach out!
